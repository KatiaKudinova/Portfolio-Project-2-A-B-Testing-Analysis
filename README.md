# Portfolio-Project-2-A-B-Testing-Analysis
This project demonstrates analysis of A/B test results using Python and Tableau to calculate statistical significance and visualize key conversion metrics.

Project Goals:

Calculate statistical significance for multiple metrics programmatically in Python.
Explore metric results across different dimensions (tests, countries, devices).
Visualize findings in an interactive Tableau dashboard highlighting significant changes.
Project Workflow:
Developed Python scripts to compute statistical significance for four key metrics: add_payment_info / session, add_shipping_info / session, begin_checkout / session, new_accounts / session.
Extended analysis to multiple dimensions for deeper insights.
Generated a CSV file with results for further visualization.
Created a Tableau dashboard to present metrics, highlight statistically significant differences, and allow filtering by test ID.
Documented the project in Google Colab, including code explanations, methodology, and conclusions.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Tableau Public
